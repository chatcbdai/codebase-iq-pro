6. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/codebase-iq-pro.git
cd codebase-iq-pro

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

```

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow PEP 8
- Use Black for formatting: `black src/`
- Use type hints where possible
- Write docstrings for all public functions/classes

### Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests

Example:
```
Add deep understanding agent for semantic analysis

- Implement AST parsing for Python and JavaScript
- Add risk assessment for file modifications
- Create comprehensive test suite

Fixes #123
```

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Run tests before submitting PR: `pytest tests/`

### Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Add docstrings to new functions/classes
- Update relevant documentation in docs/

## Agent Development

When creating new agents:

1. Inherit from `AnalysisAgent` base class
2. Implement required methods
3. Follow the existing agent patterns
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Document the agent's purpose and capabilities

Example:
```python
class MyNewAgent(AnalysisAgent):
    """Agent for analyzing specific aspect of code."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="my_new_agent",
            role=AgentRole.ANALYSIS,
            priority=5
        )
    
    async def analyze(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Perform analysis."""
        # Your implementation here
        pass
```
