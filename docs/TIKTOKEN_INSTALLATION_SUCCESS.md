# TikToken Installation Success Report

## Date: July 2, 2025

### Successfully Resolved TikToken Installation Issue

#### Environment Details:
- **Python 3.12.8** (accessed via `python` command)
- **Python 3.13.3** (accessed via `python3` command)
- **pip version**: 25.1.1 (updated from 25.0.1)

#### Installation Steps Taken:

1. **Research Phase** (July 2025):
   - Identified latest tiktoken version: 0.9.0 (released Feb 14, 2025)
   - Common issues found:
     - Missing Rust compiler for building from source
     - Python version compatibility (resolved in tiktoken 0.5.2+)
     - Build dependencies on macOS

2. **Installation Process**:
   ```bash
   # Updated pip and setuptools for Python 3.12
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
   
   # Installed tiktoken for Python 3.12
   python -m pip install tiktoken
   # Result: Successfully installed tiktoken-0.9.0
   
   # Tiktoken was already installed for Python 3.13
   # Verified with: python3 -m pip list | grep tiktoken
   ```

3. **Verification Tests**:
   ```python
   # Python 3.12 test
   python -c "import tiktoken; enc = tiktoken.get_encoding('cl100k_base'); print('Python 3.12: tiktoken installed successfully, version:', tiktoken.__version__)"
   # Output: Python 3.12: tiktoken installed successfully, version: 0.9.0
   
   # Python 3.13 test  
   python3 -c "import tiktoken; enc = tiktoken.get_encoding('cl100k_base'); print('Python 3.13: tiktoken installed successfully, version:', tiktoken.__version__)"
   # Output: Python 3.13: tiktoken installed successfully, version: 0.9.0
   ```

4. **Additional Dependencies Installed**:
   - All requirements from requirements.txt were installed
   - Key packages: aiofiles, tree-sitter, redis, black, flake8, etc.
   - Minor conflict: protobuf version (5.29.5 vs 3.20.3 required by lume)

#### Test Results:
- ✅ quick_test.py now runs successfully
- ✅ New MCP tools are properly implemented
- ✅ Deprecated analyze_codebase method correctly references new tools

#### Notes for Future Reference:
1. Always update pip and setuptools before installing tiktoken
2. For macOS users: Ensure Xcode command line tools are installed (`xcode-select --install`)
3. If building from source fails, check for pre-built wheels for your platform
4. Python 3.12+ requires tiktoken version 0.5.2 or later

#### Remaining Tasks:
- Fix deprecated analyze_codebase references in error messages
- Review and commit pending changes
- Clean up test files
